A platform for easy and powerful community websites. Powered by BuddyPress.

== Description ==

Commons In A Box dramatically lowers the barrier to building community sites on WordPress. CBOX helps you to install BuddyPress along with a number of carefully selected and vetted BuddyPress plugins, so that you don't have to worry about which plugins are best and which are compatible with each other.

CBOX also comes with a beautiful and flexible BuddyPress theme, designed from the bottom up for fostering community engagement. Powered by the [Infinity Theme Engine](http://presscrew.com/commons-in-a-box), the CBOX default theme gets you from zero to a fully-functional community theme in minutes, and also contains extensive tools for customization.

CBOX puts unique community sites within the reach of all users, no matter their technical aptitude. Visit [commonsinabox.org](http://commonsinabox.org) for support, documentation, and a growing user community.
