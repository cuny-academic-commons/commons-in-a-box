A platform for easy and powerful community websites. Powered by BuddyPress.

== Description ==

Commons In A Box (CBOX) dramatically lowers the barrier to building community sites on WordPress. CBOX helps you to install BuddyPress along with a number of carefully selected and vetted BuddyPress plugins, so that you don’t have to worry about which plugins are best and which are compatible with each other.

Commons In A Box (CBOX) includes a choice of two packages that can be customized to meet the needs of your community:

**CBOX Classic is designed for communities of all kinds.** It is used by groups and organizations to create flexible social networks where members can collaborate on projects, publish research, and create repositories of knowledge.

**CBOX OpenLab is specifically designed for teaching, learning, and collaboration.** It allows faculty members, departments, and entire institutions to create commons spaces for open learning.

Both packages feature:
- Robust out-of-the-box functionality;
- An intuitive setup process that guides site administrators through installation and customization;
- Responsive design for easy use on many devices, including tablets and smartphones;
- Ensured compatibility with a core set of plugins – when it’s time to update, you simply update CBOX and we take care of the rest;
- Compatibility with many additional WordPress and BuddyPress plugins and themes.
